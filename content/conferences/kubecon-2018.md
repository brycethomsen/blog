## Observability

## Using Operaters and Custom Controllers

## Know Thy Kubernetes

Kubecon had a huge number of tools being showcased; from [Helm](https://helm.sh/) to [Knative](https://github.com/knative/). It seemed that for every problem or variation of problem there was at least 3 tools that could resolve it and some of the tools seemed like they were inventing solutions to problems that haven't been uncovered yet.

With all of these tools at your disposal, it becomes less about which tool you choose and more about understanding Kubernetes.
